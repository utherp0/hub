HUB

Hub is a project designed to centralise multiple bookmark files and formats and provide a rich search functionality across the composite data.

There are two main components - the Hub, which translates input bookmark contents into a tree structure (with recursive leaves for nesting information pools) and
a search engine, which converts individual entries from the Hub into an indexable (Lucene Document) format and provides extended support over it.

There are a number of tests that show the functionality of the system (in org.uth.hub.tests).
